# Poker game

For this project, I created a basic high-card poker game using classes, methods and different libraries. 
```python
class Card(object):

    ranks = (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)
    suits = ('S', 'D', 'H', 'C')
```
I then modified the rank of face cards in order to give them the correct score value.
```python
def face_card (self):
        if self.rank == 14:
            rank = 'A'
        elif self.rank == 13:
            rank = 'K'
        elif self.rank == 12:
            rank = 'Q'
        elif self.rank == 11:
            rank = 'J'
        else:
            rank = self.rank
        return str(rank) + self.suit
```
I then used methods to determine the values of the hands in comparison to each other.
```python
def greater_equal (self, other):
        return (self.rank >= other.rank) 

    def less_equal (self, other):
        return (self.rank <= other.rank)

    def greater_than (self, other):
        return (self.rank > other.rank)

    def less_than (self, other):
        return (self.rank < other.rank)

    def same(self, other):
        return self.rank == other.rank

    def not_same (self, other):
        return (self.rank != other.rank)
```
From there, I created a "deck-and-deal" mechanism to distribute cards.
```python
class Deck (object):
  def __init__ (self):
    self.deck = []
    for suit in Card.suits:
      for rank in Card.ranks:
        card = Card (rank, suit)
        self.deck.append(card)

  def shuffle (self):
    random.shuffle (self.deck)

  def __len__ (self):
    return len (self.deck)

  def deal (self):
    if len(self) == 0:
      return None
    else:
      return self.deck.pop(0)
```

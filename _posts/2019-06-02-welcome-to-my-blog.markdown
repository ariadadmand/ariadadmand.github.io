 Hey, welcome to my blog. I struggled way more than I should have in creating this, but thanks to Google [and my roommate Jason], I guess I figured it out. Here's a little bit about myself. I'm originally from Vancouver, Canada; my family moved to Irvine, California when I was 13. My main sport growing up was water polo but I currently enjoy playing basketball and beer die. Back home you can probably catch me by the beach munching on ahi tuna poke with a Modelo by my side. I'm currently a Neuroscience & Cognitive Science student at the University of Arizona, hoping to find a job in neurotech after I pursue a master's degree. I decided to do iX this summer because I find machine learning intriguing and wanted to learn something new this summer. Below is my LinkedIn, let's connect. Thanks for stopping by.
